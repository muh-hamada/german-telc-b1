I want you to create a full study list of the English grammer



the list should contain sentences. The sentences should be focused on the grammer and vocabulary that are important for the English language.



the result should be a list of maybe 150 top grammer and vocabulary that are important for building the English sentences.



the sentence should use markdown to highlight the focus of each sentence. Below are a few examples



- She usually (work) _____ from home, but this week she (attend) _____ training in the main office.

- I am going to take _____ to the party.

- I don't have to _____ the dishes.

your task is to perform a deep reseach on all important grammer and scentence strcutures in English language and create a list of the top 150 scentences using markdown format.

you should use the following schema to create the list:
{
    "name": "<name of the question group>",
    "description": {
      "de": "<description of the question group in German>",
      "ar": "<description of the question group in Arabic>",

      "Fr": "<description of the question group in French>",
      "ru": "<description of the question group in Russian>",
      "es": "<description of the question group in Spanish>"
    },
    "sentences": [
      {
