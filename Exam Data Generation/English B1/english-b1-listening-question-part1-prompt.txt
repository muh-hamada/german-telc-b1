--- Interview Start ---

You're going to hear five people talking about the problem of adults who cannot read or write.

Number 41.
I can't really say that it's a serious problem because I haven't been directly affected by it, but I suppose there must be people who can't read or write. It could be a problem down in the south, but I don't understand how big city people could get by. without being able to read.

Number 42.
Absolutely. In my line of work, there have been times when I've had to read out statements to people. I've seen people sign X for their names. And among those who can sign their names, most can't even read basic English. It's a worldwide problem. People should recognize the seriousness of the problem.

Number 43.
It's a great pity that so many people can't read or write. The problem lies in a breakdown in our school system. We spend so much on other things. We should spend more on education.

Number 44.
People have to be able to read in order to advance personally and professionally. As a doctor, I meet a number of adults unable to read and write. Some were born in this country. Others have come from abroad. More program should be available to teach children and adults how to read and write English

Number 45.
There are probably millions of high school children who have reading and writing problems. For years, students have been allowed to continue their studies even though they weren't really prepared for a higher level. As a result, there are some students who can't read very well or at all.
