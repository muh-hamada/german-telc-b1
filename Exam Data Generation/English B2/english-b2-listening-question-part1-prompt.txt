Number 41.
The travel company Air Tours is facing legal action by holiday makers who fell ill at a hotel in Morca. Nearly 50 tourists fell ill. 12 of them with a stomach bug caused by the cryptosperidium bacteria. The source of the illness has been traced to the hotel swimming pool which has since been closed. Airours says it takes the safety and welfare of its customers very seriously and has offered all holiday makers alternative accommodation. While the pool and other facilities are fully investigated

Number 42.
Experts in Iceland predict further Volcanic activity may be likely after some 500 tremors were recorded last month along the lackey volcanic zone. The Fogash volcano last flared up in 1873 and caused a huge glacia meltdown, sweeping icebergs into the ocean. There have been two major volcanic discharges in Iceland in recent years, both bringing air traffic to a halt across Europe. However, Scientists say that volcanic activity of that size occurs on average only every 63 years. So it is extremely unlikely we will see such a largecale volcanic activity for several decades. 

Number 43.
Fishermen in China were amazed when they caught a huge 623 kilo coluga in their nets in the Black Dragon River in the northeast of the country. Kugas, believed to be the largest freshwater fish in the world, are only found in this region and are on the endangered list after having been fished to near extinction in the last century. Scientists were delighted to receive a call for assistance and sent a properly equipped boat to transport the animal to the safety of a local breeding center, which will help to ensure that the species survives.

Number 44.
A man in Ohio found a novel solution to his problem of always being late for work. He simply changed the traffic lights on his way to work from red to green using a device he bought on the internet. Traffic engineers had noticed repeated traffic light interruptions, and a sharp-eyed official spotted the same white pickup van on the monitoring camera at each incident. Police were able to trace the vehicle, and the driver was fined $300. Now, traffic officials are busy updating the system to make it foolproof in the future.

Number 45.
When Paul Owens was watching his neighbors struggle, to control their dog. He realized that their approach scolding and punishment was ineffective. Having a background in yoga, Owens got the idea to incorporate yoga practice into his approach on dog training. He developed a method called raise with praise, which rewards positive behavior in pets. Besides offering private training, Owens runs a charity called Pause for Peace. In Los Angeles. Inner city kids learn his methods as they train dogs from animal shelters. Owens uses yoga techniques there, too. If you're not in control of yourself, you can't be in control of your dog, he says.
