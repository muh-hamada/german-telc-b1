Experts believe unusually high Atlantic temperatures are confusing the birds' internal clocks. While tourists are delighted to see them, conservationists worry this misalignment with local food sources could impact breeding success. If the sand eels they eat aren't available yet, the chick survival rate could drop significantly this season.",

Instead of soil, they hit a lead box containing over two thousand Roman coins. Archaeologists describe the find as 'significant,' dating back to the 3rd century. The site has been temporarily secured to allow for a proper excavation, halting the supermarket build. Local museums are already bidding to display the hoard, which offers a rare glimpse into the region's ancient economic history.",
