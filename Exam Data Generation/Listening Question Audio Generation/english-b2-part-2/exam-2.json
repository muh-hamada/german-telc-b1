Today we are looking at the future of urban transport, specifically the push to get people out of their cars and onto bicycles. Cities across the country are declaring a 'cycling revolution,' investing millions in new lanes and schemes. Yet, traffic congestion remains at an all-time high. It seems that while we like the idea of cycling, we are struggling to let go of our car keys. To discuss why this shift is so difficult, we have Mark Evans, an urban mobility planner who has worked with councils across the UK. Mark, welcome. Is the revolution actually happening?",

        "text": "Hello Sarah. Well, it is and it isn't. If you look at bicycle sales figures, they have gone through the roof in the last five years. However, owning a bike and using it for your daily commute are two very different things. Research suggests that while many people are buying bikes, they are primarily using them for weekend leisure in parks, rather than replacing their Monday to Friday car journeys. So, we have more cyclists, but sadly, not necessarily fewer cars on the road during rush hour.",

        "text": "Safety is undoubtedly the number one barrier. You can't just paint a white line on the side of a busy road and call it a cycle lane. Most people do not feel comfortable cycling inches away from a bus or a lorry. To truly reduce car reliance, we need what we call 'segregated infrastructure'—physical barriers that separate cyclists from heavy traffic, much like they have in the Netherlands. Until people feel physically safe, they will naturally prefer the metal box of their car.",

If you look at cities in Scandinavia, like Copenhagen or Oulu in Finland, they have much harsher winters than we do, yet their cycling rates are huge. The weather isn't the issue; it's the clothing and the culture. As for hills, the boom in electric bikes has completely solved that problem. An e-bike flattens the city. It allows you to arrive at work without being sweaty or exhausted. The technology is there; we just need the mindset to change.",

Drivers tend to do one big shop at a supermarket and drive home. Cyclists stop more frequently, perhaps grabbing a coffee or buying small items on their way. Making a street pedestrian and cycle-friendly actually boosts the local economy, though it can be hard to convince shop owners of this initially.",

This friction usually happens because they are fighting for the same small amount of road space. The solution brings us back to infrastructure. If you build proper lanes where cars and bikes don't interact, the conflict disappears. You don't see road rage between a train driver and a pilot because they have their own paths. We need to design our streets so that cyclists and drivers aren't constantly in each other's way.",
