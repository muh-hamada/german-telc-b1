--- Interview Start ---

You're going to hear a report about travel care, a service that Gatwick Airport offers for travelers with problems.

Ruth London, a travel care employee, will be telling the reporter about her work and some of the people she has helped.

It's a weekday morning at Gatwick Airport. In the offices of travel care. The airport emergency service for travelers. The week's first case is fast asleep. For the past 3 days, Tomaso, an 18-year-old Italian, has been trying to avoid the Gatwick airport police, sleeping wherever he can before being moved on. Ruth London, a former British Airways stewardess, one of three part-time advisers employed by Travel Care, would like to do more to help, but Tomaso hasn't made it easy for her. He came here on a one-way flight, hoping some relatives in Wales would look after him, but they don't want him. Since then, I can only suppose he's been sleeping rough. It was Ruth who helped him when he first arrived at Gatwick last month without a penny to his name. When she requested assistance from the Italian embassy, she was told they had given Tomaso a return train ticket back to Italy some weeks before.
Unfortunately, he didn't speak English. So, we employed the services of a young Italian woman who works as a waitress at the Gatwick coffee shop. Through her, we discovered that he had torn up his train ticket, but we couldn't find out why. And when finally the local Italian police made contact with his mother, the answer came back that she doesn't want to know him either.
Last year, 23 million people visited Gatwick and 2,000 of them ended up being helped by travel care. Among them was Darren Tyler, a 23-year-old student from Belfast.
Darren arrived here just over a fortnight ago on the promise of a job in London. But when he got there, the family friend who had guaranteed him the work had already given the job to his own son. Darren stayed with the family for 2 weeks, but the relationship soon got difficult. And one night he turned up here at Gatwick after his mother told told him she had booked him onto a return flight. When he got here, he found out that his mom hadn't booked him on the flight after all, so he'd been sleeping in the airport. Like most Gatwick passengers, Darren had never heard of Travel Care. The service does not advertise its presence. They have learned from past experience and no longer consider themselves to be an easy option for people trying to get a cheap holiday.
Some People do try thinking we'll give them money on any old excuse, but I never give them the cash. I always go to the ticket office with them. If they're young or are not particularly helpful about who we could contact, we show them where the motorway is. We'll give them sandwiches and something to drink to prepare them for the journey. But it's amazing how often fathers will pay the money for tickets once travel care has got them on the phone.
Brit. leads the world in emergency help for travelers. Apart from a similar organization at London's other airport, Heathrow, no other airport in the world offers such a service. Travel Care is financed by Gatwick Airport Limited, British Airways, and the British government. They also receive money from private people, some of them grateful for help they themselves have received. This money pays for the three employees and 12 other assistants, most of them former airport staff, ranging from airport directors to duty-free shop assistants. But in spite of all the facilities they have here at Travel Care, there are a few travelers who simply cannot be helped. You get some people who are very religious and they turn up at the airport believing God will help. One woman I remember told us that she didn't need any help because God would find a way for her to fly to America to see her son. She waited at Gatwick for 2 days, but no help came.
All of which, I suppose, just goes to prove that God does not provide airline tickets.
