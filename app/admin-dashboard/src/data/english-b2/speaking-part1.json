      "examplePresentation": "Hello, today I would like to present the book 'The Reader' by Bernhard Schlink. The theme of the book revolves around guilt, love, and the aftereffects of the Holocaust on German society. The plot is set in the 1950s and tells the story of a young man named Michael who enters into a relationship with an older woman named Hanna. Later, he learns that Hanna is involved in a war crimes trial. The author, Bernhard Schlink, is a German lawyer and writer who published the book in 1995. The characters are portrayed with nuance: Michael is a sensitive teenager struggling with his past, and Hanna is a complex figure who is illiterate and falls into moral dilemmas because of it. The style is clear and concise, written from a first-person perspective that emphasizes the protagonist's inner conflicts. In my opinion, the book is impressive because it raises ethical questions and encourages the reader to reflect, even though it is sometimes emotionally difficult to bear. It helped me think more deeply about German history.",
